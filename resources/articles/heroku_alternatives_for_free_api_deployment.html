<h1>The journey of deploying this blog</h1>
<p class="mt-4 text-justify">
  Before starting the development of this blog I was thinking; "which technology I'm going to use?". I know,
  not ideal to think about which technology to use in the first steps of development, but since it was just a
  personal blog post, all good.
</p>
<p class="mt-4 text-justify">
  <a target="_blank" class="text-[color:--highlight]" href="https://athenna.io">Athenna Framework</a>
  is fully capable of returning views in HTTP requests so why not? The support for it
  is not yet the best in the market when compared to other frameworks, but tools like
  <a target="_blank" class="text-[color:--highlight]" href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine.js</a>
  gave you a lot of power for developing monolith applications.
</p>
<h1 class="mt-4">The problem</h1>
<p class="mt-4 text-justify">
  Everything was looking fine and pretty, it felt amazing to escape the complexity of
  the frontend framework ecosystem. The only problem I faced on this journey was with
  the deployment, an API cannot be deployed in tools like
  <a target="_blank" class="text-[color:--highlight]" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>
  because it only supports static files. I didn't want to pay for a simple blog website
  and Heroku was now <strong>paid only</strong>.
</p>
<h1 class="mt-4">The solution</h1>
<p class="mt-4 text-justify">
  After some research, I found an amazing alternative for Heroku called
  <a target="_blank" class="text-[color:--highlight]" href="https://render.com">Render</a>.
  It works very well, giving you all the nice features Heroku gives like Git repository
  integration and defining build and start scripts. So if you have any API that you
  need to deploy for a quick test, I recommend them.
